# W002

W002 basically tells you what Gamma suggests you to do:
```
warning[W002]: use '=>' in abstractions
 --> ..\tests\var_override.gm:1:12
  |
1 | let i = \x . x;
  |            ^ help: use '=>' instead of '.' because Gamma uses different syntax rather than usual one in Lambda calculus.
```

In Gamma it is recommended to use '=>' instead of '.' for more readability.
